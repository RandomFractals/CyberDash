# CyberDash - smarter Twitter news bot

This simple keywords search Twitter bot was originally created to keep up with cyberSec news and seed Dasher: https://twitter.com/CyberDash

I extended it for the webpack dev community as an experiment to guage webpack feedback in its second incarnation. See it running in a hybrid mode at https://twitter.com/WebPackSense and scroll down for more info.

You can use this node.js Twitter bot code to create your own Twitter news feed for the topics of your interest, or for augmenting your existing Twitter account to become a subject matter expert in your domain, as most top Twitter 'influencers' do :) Just follow the build, config, test, debug, run and bot deploy instructions below.

Be creative! Fork and mode it at will!

> Read Twitter automation ground rules before you proceed to running your own bot
https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation

The settings I've chosen for this Twitter bot limit the number of RT's your bot will send to comply with Twitter rules and rate limit regulations. Fine tune them at your own risk :(

# Test

Before you run your new Twitter bot, please consider testing it first.

Change log level to debug for this bot to skip the actual retweet or quoted tweet step and output matching tweets trace.

in your .env bot config file change this line to debug:

```
# Bot log level
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This option is also handy to fine-tune mute tweet and user keywords config, and ban spam users by building a private 'blacklist' Twitter list to ignore marketing and spammy Twitter users and bots.

Once you are happy with the results change log level to info for this Twitter bot to start retweeting or generating quoted tweet rating tweets in 'rate' bot mode. See src/bot.js code for what is done in 'rate' bot mode. Modify as desired.

# RT and Rate Twitter Bot Config

For an example of a hybrid rate quoted tweets and retweets with links see WebPackSense.env bot config, and the actual Twitter bot I created for the webpack dev community: https://twitter.com/WebPackSense

From the first fews days of testing and running that bot to collect good webpack reads and guage webdev's feedback on that framework:

![Alt text](https://github.com/RandomFractals/CyberDash/blob/master/screens/WebPackSensePromo2017.png?raw=true 
 "@WebPackSense")

Rate and RT bot log trace from the first 20 hours of day 1 on the job :)

![Alt text](https://github.com/RandomFractals/CyberDash/blob/master/screens/WebPackSenseAlpha20hrsRunDay1Trace.png?raw=true 
 "@WebPackSense")

NOTE: 

- every . in that trace is a skipped tweet due to bot config rules. 
- | denotes a straight up retweet of a tweet with a link.
- new followers get logged and sent our greeting DM.
- tweets without links generate a quoted tweet with emojis sentiment rating :)

# 1. Run realtime Twitter stream/filter bot (default)

>node src/stream

sample trace output (old pic from week 1 of bot dev :(

![Alt text](https://github.com/RandomFractals/CyberDash/blob/master/screens/CyberDashTrace7.png?raw=true 
 "trace")

NOTE: 

- every . in that trace denotes a matching tweet analyzed and skipped according to the bot config rules. See 'Dasher's' :) timeline for actual RT's: https://twitter.com/CyberDash
- new followers get a greeting DM
- bot 'blacklist' is updated every 15 minutes for currating that channel live as new tweets come in and you detect noise tweet sources
- your friends, bots and tweeps you follow, are automatically added to the bot 'whitelist', which is updated every hour. tweets from friends on the subject keywords you configured don't require a link to be retweeted

There is probably more that this bot does that escapes my recollection after 2 weeks of coding and tweeking it for the 2 Twitter bot accounts I've set up. I suggest you review src/bot.js code and mod for your needs. That code is heavily documented and nicely formatted. Enjoy! Buy me a beer some day if you end up using this custom Twitter news bot code.

# 2. OR Run search.js for periodic RT's

>node src/search

search/tweets 'webpack' bot run trace sample:

# Deploy your custom Twitter news bot to Heroku

The best way to put your custom Twitter news bot on auto-pilot is to deploy it to Heroku, and run it in a worker dyno, after initial local testing and config. Heroku worker dyno's are free to use for low volume feeds. 

Here is a sample log of my WebPackSense Twitter bot running on Heroku in a worker dyno configured to filter realtime tweets about webpack via stream.js:

 "workerLog")

![Alt text](https://github.com/RandomFractals/CyberDash/blob/master/screens/WebPackSenseWorkerProcessLog.png?raw=true 
 "workerLog2")

# v3.x TODO

- Plug in smarter sentiments lib or service call for rating quoted tweets without links.
- hook up redis and check for tweet duplicates from tweeps that post same articles every day for promo
- add different match algo's?: contains, regex, or http://compromise.cool/
- add followBack(user) to new user stream follower event to see what that looks like? Automate! :)
